SnapBBS mirror - neat little flatfile textboard-esque BBS software, 
written in PHP and downloaded from some onion site around 2011 or 2012.
I thought I lost my archive forever ago, but I found it recently. I had 
made some changes and lost the admin password, so it took me awhile to 
try and revery things to as vanilla as possible. The original README.txt 
and LICENSE.txt are provided, although it should be noted that the 
default admin password is a lowercase "password" instead of the 
"Password" stated in the readme.
uhh, other than that, just make sure the directory is writable, and 
maybe chmod+x some files? idk I just +x and 777 everything while testing
